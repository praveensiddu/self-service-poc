<h2>Allocated</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Allocated</strong> shows the number of L4 ingress IPs that have been successfully allocated for this purpose in the cluster.
</p>

<h3>Understanding this value</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This represents the actual IPs that have been provisioned and are available for use.</li>
  <li>When "Allocated" matches "Requested", the allocation is complete.</li>
  <li>If "Allocated" is less than "Requested", you can use the "Allocate" action to provision the remaining IPs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Actions</h3>
<p>
  Use the "Allocate" button in the Actions column to automatically allocate additional IPs up to the requested amount.
