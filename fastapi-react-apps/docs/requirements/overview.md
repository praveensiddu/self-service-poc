# Requirements Overview

## Problem statement

Provide a self-service portal to manage application and namespace configuration in Kubernetes/OpenShift using a GitOps workflow (requests/control/templates/rendered repositories). The system exposes a web UI and a REST API to create/update/delete apps, manage namespaces, manage cluster definitions, and manage network-related controls such as Egress IPs and L4 ingress IP allocation.

## Goals

- Provide a consistent UI and API for day-2 operations on app/namespace configuration.
- Enforce RBAC and optional read-only operation.
- Persist changes as GitOps-friendly YAML in workspace repositories.
- Provide feedback on pending changes (PRs / requests changes).

## Non-goals

- Directly mutating the Kubernetes cluster from the API server.
- Acting as a full CI/CD system; the portal initiates GitOps changes but does not replace GitOps controllers.

## Personas

- **Viewer**: Read-only access to apps, namespaces, and cluster information.
- **Manager**: Can manage apps/namespaces (within scope), request allocations.
- **Platform Admin**: Manages clusters, global enforcement settings, and administrative workflows.

## Glossary

- **Workspace**: Local directory where repositories are cloned and manipulated.
- **Requests repo**: Source-of-truth for requested app/namespace configuration.
- **Control repo**: Source-of-truth for cluster inventory and platform settings.
- **Rendered repo**: Output manifests and allocation state generated by automation.
- **Egress Name ID**: Identifier used to reserve and share an Egress IP across namespaces.

## Key user journeys

- Create app → create namespace → configure quotas/limits/rolebindings → request Egress IP.
- View app networking status: L4 ingress requests and Egress IP allocations.
- Platform admin adds/edits clusters and datacenters, configures enforcement.
