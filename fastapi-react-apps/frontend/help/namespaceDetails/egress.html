  Without an EgressIP, pod egress traffic uses the IP address of the underlying Kubernetes node. Because workloads can run on any node, outbound traffic may originate from any node IP in the cluster.

To enforce egress controls using an external firewall, all node IPs would need to be allow-listed. In a multi-tenant environment, this undermines tenant isolation by permitting unintended access to sensitive back-end systems required by only one tenant. <p><strong>Egress Name ID</strong>: Identifier used to reserve and use an egress IP for this namespace. Multiple namespaces within the same application can use the same egress IP by using the same egress name id.</p>
  <p><strong>Enable Pod Based Egress IP</strong>: When enabled, pods may receive an egress IP based on pod-specific rules (if supported in your environment).</p>
