<h2>Egress Name ID</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Egress Name ID</strong> is an optional identifier that links this namespace to an existing egress IP configuration.
  If set, outbound traffic for this namespace will be routed through the corresponding egress IP.
</p>

<h3>When to use</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use this when you need the namespace’s egress traffic to come from a specific IP.</li>
  <li>Leave it empty if the namespace does not require dedicated egress routing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recommended default</h3>
<p>
  By default, this field is prefilled with the application name to make it easy to align egress routing with the app.
